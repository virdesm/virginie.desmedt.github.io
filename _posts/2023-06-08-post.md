Design of a Business Activity Monitoring timeline to visualise the events occurring on a single project throughout either the project as a whole or throughout one or more phases of the project. 
Any timeslice during the lifecycle of a project can be selected and focussed upon. 
Thus the user can control the "granularity" of the required information.
