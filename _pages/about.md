I currently work as a digital coordinator, where I develop new user-facing features, improve core parts of the app, write documentation, advocate for accessibility, mentor developers, and share new things I’m learning with the team. I thrive in collaborative environments that encourage growth, offer varied learning opportunities, and cultivate my problem-solving skills and creative strengths. In this role, my main missions involve establishing the customer need through an analysis of the feasibility of a project, identifying necessary resources, presenting the project outcomes but also leading the digital project from A to Z ensuring compliance with the planning, quality requirements and budget of a project.

I have experience as being responsible for coordinating the launch of a range of digital projects such as corporate websites and of ensuring the project runs smoothly. This means making sure it’s completed on time, within the planned budget, and that the quality of the delivered project is guaranteed. The scope is to keep both your team members and clients happy along the way!
I have a torough knowledge of React, TypeScript, and CSS and can pick up new languages quickly as needed. Some of my interests include web performance and accessibility.
